# AI-Powered Weather Advisory and Recommendation System

## üå¶ Project Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Weather Advisory and Recommendation System** that leverages **NASA MERRA-2 historical Earth observation data** to provide personalized, interactive weather insights. Unlike traditional weather apps, which offer only 6‚Äì7 day forecasts, this system uses Earth data to **project weather patterns up to 7‚Äì8 months ahead**. The application combines **data analytics, AI/LLM reasoning, and interactive UI/UX** to suggest suitable activities, clothing, food, and essentials based on predicted weather conditions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Map Selection**: Users can drop a pin or search for any location worldwide.
- **Date & Parameter Selection**: Choose specific dates and weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, windspeed, humidity, snow, and dust/air quality.
- **Data Analysis**: Processes NASA MERRA-2 data to compute mean, max, min, and probability of extreme weather.
- **AI Recommendations**: Uses a free open-source LLM to dynamically generate:
  - Outdoor activities
  - Clothing suggestions
  - Essentials and food items
  - Safety precautions
- **Image Integration**: Fetches 1‚Äì3 relevant images per item from free APIs (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay) to enrich recommendations.
- **Visualization**: Charts, heatmaps, and probability trends.
- **Download Options**: Export results as CSV, JSON, or PDF.

## ‚ö° Challenge Addressed
Traditional weather apps provide only **short-term forecasts** and lack **actionable guidance**. Users see temperatures or rainfall probabilities but do not know **how to act** on them. This system makes complex NASA climate data **understandable, visual, and actionable**, helping users make **smart, informed decisions**.

## üåç Importance
By combining **NASA-grade accuracy**, **AI reasoning**, and **intuitive UI**, the application promotes **sustainable, informed living**. Users can plan outdoor activities, dress appropriately, and prepare essentials while understanding **long-term climate trends**.
